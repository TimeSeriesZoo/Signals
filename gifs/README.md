# Signal Visualizer Gifs

This folder is a collection of visualizers created for exploration signal processing.

Re-use is allowed, following the included license.

Available visualizers include:
- `convolution-short`: animated application of convolution, with a long kernel
- `convolution-long`: animated application of convolution, with a short kernel
- `fft-aperiodic`: animated decomposition of the Fourier transform, applied to an aperiodic signal
- `fft-periodic`: animated decomposition of the Fourier transform, applied to a signal with periodic component
- `ts-osc`: time series, and associated power spectrum, of an oscillation
- `ts-white-noise`: time series, and associated power spectrum, of white noise
- `ts-pink-noise`: time series, and associated power spectrum, of pink noise
- `ts-brown-noise`: time series, and associated power spectrum, of brown noise
- `ts-comb`: time series, and associated power spectrum, of a combined signal, with an oscillation and pink noise
- `ts-comb-burst`: time series, and associated power spectrum, of a combined signal, with a bursty oscillation and pink noise
