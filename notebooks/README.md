# Signal Visualizers

This folder contains the notebooks & code that create the signal visualizer gifs.

Each visualization is created by a dedicated notebook.
The code in this repository creates all the images needed for the gifs,
but the gifs need to be stitched together, which is currently done with an external service.

## Notebooks

The current list of notebooks:

### 01 - Time Series Signals

Notebook to create animated examples of aperiodic signals (colored noise).

### 02 - FFT

### 03 - Convolution
