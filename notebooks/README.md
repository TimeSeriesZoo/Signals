# Signal Visualizers

This folder contains the notebooks & code that create the signal visualizer gifs.

Each visualization is created by a dedicated notebook. 
The code in this repository creates all the images needed for the gifs, 
but the gifs need to be stitched together, which is currently done with an external service.

Note that each of the visualizations is an animated version of one of the figures from the 
[paper](https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/ejn.15361).
The original code that these animations are based on is available in the 
[project repository](https://github.com/OscillationMethods/OscillationMethods).

## Notebooks

The current list of notebooks:

### 1 - FFT

Notebook to create animated decompositions of the fast Fourier transform (FFT). 

### 2 - Aperiodic Signals

Notebook to create animated examples of aperiodic signals (colored noise).
