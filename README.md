# Signal Visualizers

This is the source repository for the `SigViz` collection of animated visualizers of signal processing.

## Overview

This repository includes the code to create the animated visualization, as well as copies of the final outputs.

To view the visualizers, you can visit the SigViz
[website](https://tomdonoghue.github.io/SigViz/).

## ReUse

Copies of the animated visualizations are available in the `gifs/` folder.
These visualization are available for re-use under a Creative Commons
[CC-BY 4.0](https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/)
license, meaning re-use, with attribution, is allowed.

The code to create these visualizations is available in the `notebooks/` folder, under the
[MIT License](https://github.com/TomDonoghue/SigViz/blob/main/notebooks/LICENSE),
meaning if you wish to use and adapt this code, you may do so.

## Visualizations

Visualizations created in this repository include:
- creating and visualization time series of periodic, aperiodic, and periodic signals
- animated visualizers exploring the Fast Fourier Transform (FFT)
- animated visualizers for convolution

## Examples

A subset of visualizers are shown here, as examples.

For the full set of visualizers, see the

### Fast Fourier Transform

An FFT gif, decomposing a signal with aperiodic activity and a periodic component:

### Convolution

A convolution gif, showing the convolution of a signal (grey) with a Gaussian kernel (red).
